                    expertise required to find a suitable job and keep it, nor do they cover all the 
                    expenses involved. This is where Chaperon comes 
                    into play.
                    We accompany the unemployed and job seekers as they sail on these wavy waters of 
                    finding and keeping jobs. We offer accommodation, training, education, and cover

                    be available for all. We also want to seed the alliance for agro-businesses, which is

          <p>Homocracy is a trade system that makes sure every Major Human Individual (MHI) has their 
                    share on all resources that support human existence, in the country, first, then on earth. 
                    To achieve this goal, we must harness the full power of a cell phone, a personal computer, 
                    servers, and cloud computing. The economy that goes from a sensor-like device, 
                    like a cell phone, all the way into the cloud is called “creator economy”. We will 
                    associate an MHI to a cell phone, named “HoFi (Home Finances)”, so as to migrate all 
                    the trade system into the cloud. Hence, we can turn a cell phone into currency, id card, passport, driver's licence, 
                    and more, paving the way for World Federal Government. All of the other cooperatives 
                    will become a reality, creating a single trade system cloud, per nation, 
                    then a single global cloud. eCard is a telecom company that aims to develop a card 
                    that works as the HoFi cellphone which, coupled with HoFi, will be used by all citizens

        <p>Laastras reforms trade through Services Exchange and Virtual Currency. It supports fairness, financial security, and inclusivity for all.</p>
        <span class="read-more-link" onclick="toggleReadMore(this)">Read more</span>
        <div class="read-more-content">
          <p>We have done trade for ages. The trade model has failed to give us financial security 
                    coupled with self-sufficiency. Let alone conflicts that result from attempts to secure 
                    and retain control of our businesses. We went a step further: philanthropy. We believed 
                    it could end poverty and give us all equal opportunities. It won't work either. Until 
                    Laastras trade model is adopted we cannot surround ourselves with financial security, 
                    self-sufficiency, equal opportunities, satisfying employment for all, and conflict-free 
                    businesses. How so? Laastras reforms trade by way of two impacts:
                   <ul><li>Replace remuneration-based work with Services Exchange. One job related to 
                    “management of resources that support human existence” (Morshux) unlocks 
                        remuneration through all the other services in Morshux, yielding financial 
                        security and self-sufficiency. Gone are business conflicts, too.
                    </li><li>Replace material currency with Virtual Currency . With Morshux self-sufficiency, 
                        one is better positioned to release their full potential through creativity 
                        over Morshux owned assets. We then export those assets through trade that uses 
                        Virtual Currency, which is more flexible, easy to transact with, 
                        secure enough, and fits well in E-commerce and Logistics, pillars of any trade.</li></ul>
                    Laastras is built on the principle of ‘Internet of our Things (IooT)’ and delivers 
                    services that will, in the long run, fulfil the Morshux vision. For details on 
                    the Morshux philosophy, please, support the project by seeing
