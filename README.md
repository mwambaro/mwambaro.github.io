# Laastras

This website explains the mission of a start-up called `Laastras`. It explains its general framework
and the major brands that will lead to the accomplishment of the mission. It is a static website that uses
FormSubmit.co to send the needed form input to the Admin's email. It is freely hosted on Github Pages.

Next, add Esc key support to close the full-screen viewer, add fade-in/out animation for the overlay, add mouse becomes pointer on hovering the clickable images. Remember, no displaying the code in a canvas, just give the full-site code .html file for download.

In the code there is fullscreen overlay support that allows targetted images to be displayed. I will define 
forms that must be displayed in the overlay too, so you can add logic that does that. Make the forms very appealing using TailwindCSS as it is the case for the rest of the code. The forms support FormSubmit to onkezabahizi@gmail.com.
The current fullscreen overlay shows images only. I now want the same overlay to also display the forms, each triggered by specific link IDs. Remember, do not display the full-site code in a canvas, rather give it as .html file for download. Here is how the forms are defined:

- Form 1: It fires up when you click on a link tag whose id is "learn-more". Here are its fields:
    1. Invisible input field named "subject" whose value is set to "Learn more about GetClientele".
    2. Input field named "full_name" in which the user inputs his/her full name.

Given the code that contains forms, add validations. Give the resulting full code without omitting anything
as a .html file for download. You must validate:
- Full name as required, not blank
- Email as required, not blank, and ensure the email format
- Phone number as required, not blank, and according to the number leading with country code as in +25776177186
- Textarea message as required, not blank, and with a maximum of 3000 characters.
I want further enhancements, like inline error messages, highlighting invalid fields.
